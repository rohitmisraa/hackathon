                                        Description: A mobile application needs to be developed to streamline and
                                        automate
                                        the attendance tracking of its employees across multiple office locations for
                                        Uttrakhand Region. This
                                        application will leverage geolocation technology to record employee check-in and
                                        check-out times along with geo-location as they enter and leave the office
                                        premises.
                                        Aim of this App is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual attendance
                                        tracking errors, and provide a seamless experience for employees to manage their
                                        work-related movements. Key Requirements: 1) Geolocation-Based Check-In and
                                        Check-Out: Automatically record check-in time and geo-location when an employee
                                        enters within a 200-meter radius of his office. Record check-out time when the
                                        employee leaves the 200-meter radius. Ensure that each check-in is paired with a
                                        corresponding check-out, regardless of the frequency of entries and exits. 2)
                                        Manual
                                        Location Check-In / Check-Out for Offsite Work: Provide a manual check-in and
                                        check-out feature for employees working at locations other than his offices.
                                        Automatically suggest relevant locations based on real-time longitude and
                                        latitude
                                        data, allowing employees to confirm their check-in and check-out at these
                                        suggested
                                        locations. 3) Calculate the employees total working hours. 4) Data Accuracy and
                                        Integrity: Ensure the application maintains accurate and tamper-proof records of
                                        all
                                        check-in and check-out events. Enable real-time data synchronization and secure
                                        storage to prevent data loss and ensure reliability. Youtube Link/Video Link (3

                                        Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which
                                        form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens
                                        that
                                        are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by
                                        offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the
                                        significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes.
                                        Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden
                                        that is
                                        engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include:

                                        Comprehensive
                                        details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat,
                                        medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality
                                        images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience.

                                        allow
                                        users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social
                                        media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal
                                        Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners,
                                        and
                                        enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of
                                        medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and
                                        understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing,
                                        informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that
                                        combines technology with traditional knowledge.

                                        Background: In modern educational settings, managing classrooms efficiently
                                        while ensuring a conducive learning environment is crucial. Traditional methods
                                        of classroom management are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human
                                        error, which can disrupt the learning process. Leveraging software-based
                                        solutions in classroom management can enhance operational efficiency, ensure
                                        safety, and create an engaging learning atmosphere for students. This project
                                        aims to develop a smart software solution to streamline classroom operations,
                                        improve resource utilization, and enhance the overall learning experience.
                                        Detailed Description: The Smart Classroom Management Software (SCMS) can utilize
                                        advanced algorithms, data analytics, and cloud-based technologies to automate
                                        various aspects of classroom management. The system can potentially include (but
                                        not limited to) features such as: 1. Attendance Automation: Use facial
                                        recognition algorithms or mobile app-based check-ins to automatically record
                                        student attendance. Generate real-time attendance reports accessible by teachers
                                        and administration. 2. Resource Management: Track the usage of classroom
                                        resources such as projectors, computers, and other teaching aids through a

                                        Background: Urban areas often face significant traffic congestion, especially at
                                        intersections where multiple routes converge. Traditional traffic management
                                        systems rely on pre-set traffic light timings, which may not adapt well to
                                        fluctuating traffic conditions. This can lead to increased waiting times, fuel

                                        Background: Angiography is a common medical imaging technique used to visualize
                                        the inside of blood vessels and detect blockages. Description: However,
                                        typically medical tests like radionuclide angiography involve the use of
                                        radioactive contrast agents, which can pose risks to patients, including
                                        radiation exposure and allergic reactions. There is a growing need for safer,

                                        Background: Water scarcity is a major challenge in agriculture, leading to
                                        inefficient water use and reduced crop yields. Traditional irrigation methods
                                        often result in overuse or underuse of water. Description: Develop a smart

                                        Background: lndia has emerged as leading milk producer country in the world,
                                        however productivity of dairy animals is very low. To improve the productivity
                                        of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high
                                        genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to
                                        access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health
                                        traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced
                                        approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al.
                                        Description: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a
                                        portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by
                                        mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions.
                                        Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the
                                        farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is
                                        crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery system in lndia. Semen
                                        doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized
                                        containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage
                                        and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain.
                                        The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen
                                        poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen
                                        storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation.
                                        Expected solution: . There is a need to explore and promote alternative,
                                        cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of
                                        semen doses . The design, material, type of insulation of storage containers can
                                        also help in cost effectiveness, reduction in losses, compactness and ease of

                                        Background: Management of solid waste has been one of the key problem in most of
                                        the cities around the world. The failure is evident from burgeoning growth of
                                        landfill site into mountain of MSW. Waste management accounts for a
                                        comparatively very high share of national GHG emissions in several countries
                                        worldwide. Emissions of methane following the disposal of waste in landfill
                                        account for a large share of GHG emissions from waste management. Description:

                                        are very often unable to cope with. This is true in case of solid waste disposal
                                        and management as well. The main objectives of solid waste management are to
                                        reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, promote recycling, and
                                        minimize the negative effects of waste on the environment and human health

                                        peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer
                                        months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes
                                        imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.
                                        Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the
                                        minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer
                                        months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and
                                        second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes
                                        during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve
                                        effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there

                                        growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In
                                        addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the
                                        fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load
                                        is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial
                                        load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the
                                        State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having
                                        considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally
                                        given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early
                                        morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State'
                                        Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase
                                        stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and
                                        Slot-wise power is more expensive. Expected Solution: An Artificial Intelligence

                                        Background: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) occur when the dam containing a
                                        glacial lake fails, releasing large volumes of water suddenly and causing
                                        catastrophic downstream flooding. Climate change is increasing the number and
                                        size of glacial lakes, heightening the risk of GLOFs. Curent monitoring and
                                        prediction methods can be improved with advanced technologies like remote
                                        sensing, sensors installed near glacial lakes and machine learning. •

                                        may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and
                                        property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting
                                        the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage
                                        between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian
                                        shipping industry. Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing
                                        application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is
                                        available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial
                                        potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized
                                        for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature
                                        range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such
                                        as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and
                                        ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route
                                        must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a
                                        ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable
                                        optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships
                                        (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an
                                        algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The
                                        algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a
                                        scope for addition of more optimization parameters. To get an idea of the

                                        duration audio file. The system to be able to function at high performance when
                                        very few (Few Shot) examples per keyword are given for training. The key
                                        features of the system would be as mentioned below: - (a) The system should be
                                        language agnostic (b) The system should be able to handle audio files at various

                                        significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river
                                        system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly
                                        accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to
                                        make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the
                                        rivers of Ganga Basin. Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be
                                        developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data,
                                        IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements,
                                        in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological &
                                        hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical
                                        patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River. Model source
                                        code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The
                                        models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and
                                        temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time
                                        series database and automated workflows continually check observations against
                                        forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the
                                        model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure
                                        the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may
                                        operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to
                                        a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality
                                        forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set
                                        up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling. The overall strategy for
                                        the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or
                                        watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water
                                        quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series
                                        of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app,
                                        to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast
                                        future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a
                                        warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a
                                        significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like
                                        weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users
                                        can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory
                                        agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency
                                        sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for
                                        compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.
                                        Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with
                                        focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is
                                        envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow
                                        and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple
                                        locations in a river network. a. To create historical simulations of flow and
                                        water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down
                                        the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general
                                        public might use. b. Dashboard may show the following options i. Ganga River set
                                        up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus,
                                        DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc. ii. It may show a time series plot of
                                        paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the
                                        Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days. 2. Alrets can
                                        be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g.,
                                        pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events,
                                        or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system. 3. DSS-based
                                        post-project monitoring to validate the benefit of government investments.

                                        Background 1. Article 243G of the Constitution of India acknowledges Panchayats
                                        as institutions of local self-government and mandates them to prepare plans for
                                        economic development and social justice. As local government, Gram Panchayats
                                        (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services to local citizens and
                                        address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones. This can only be
                                        achieved through implementation of well thought out plans through efficient and
                                        responsible utilization of available resources. 2. An efficient and robust
                                        planning process as part of GP’s core functioning becomes necessary. GP
                                        development plan should ideally match people’s needs and priorities with the
                                        available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive,
                                        transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development
                                        issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and
                                        solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision.
                                        3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective
                                        implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National
                                        importance. The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be
                                        comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the
                                        full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29
                                        subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. 4. A need was felt
                                        to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile,
                                        i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional
                                        mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part
                                        IX areas. Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating
                                        17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals
                                        (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ‘Whole of Government and
                                        Whole of Society Approach’ and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic
                                        approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India. 29 Subjects defined in

                                        development The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help
                                        villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A simulated
                                        environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game
                                        where the user can plan various facilities in the village using the resources
                                        available. It is envisaged to develop ‘Farmville’ kind of a game for a village.
                                        Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android
                                        platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input.
                                        Key Components to include for the game app: Budget Estimate: Functionality to
                                        add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For
                                        example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat /
                                        village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning. Work
                                        Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat
                                        Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction,
                                        establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc. The basic steps of the Game broadly
                                        involve: - i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the
                                        villagers. ii. Based on the input received such as the village building
                                        footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing
                                        village for which development plan is required. iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA
                                        Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village. iv.
                                        Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would
                                        be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying
                                        of drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the
                                        villagers, etc. v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats
                                        under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the
                                        development activity as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount
                                        shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats. vi.
                                        Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features. vii. Arrive at
                                        a tentative estimate for the planning being performed. viii. Ability to provide
                                        a walkthrough of the 3D platform. ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D
                                        platform. A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: - Case1:
                                        Road laying activity • The player selects the start point and endpoint with
                                        intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to
                                        validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction
                                        plan. • The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of
                                        the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game.
                                        Based on changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road,
                                        it should be regenerated. • Once the road construction is done by the player,
                                        cost of construction should be auto generated. • Ability to measure the road
                                        dimensions and road shoulders. Case 2: Streetlight • The player selects the road
                                        where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game
                                        artefacts. • The player has option to check the light illumination based on the
                                        time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to
                                        change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change – the changes to reflect on
                                        the game for best results. • Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street
                                        lighting to be generated. Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and
                                        width of each side. • The player selects the village for developmental activity.
                                        • The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected
                                        village. • The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create
                                        the dimension of the house along with roof type area. Expected Solution
                                        Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times,
                                        exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan
                                        to develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat
                                        development plan activities. • A detailed game outlining the work model. •
                                        Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface. • Documentation on
                                        implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification
                                        system into the Hackathon event. 1. Article 243G of the Constitution of India
                                        acknowledges Panchayats as institutions of local self-government and mandates
                                        them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. As local
                                        government, Gram Panchayats (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services
                                        to local citizens and address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones.
                                        This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out plans
                                        through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources. 2. An
                                        efficient and robust planning process as part of GP’s core functioning becomes
                                        necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people’s needs and
                                        priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair,
                                        inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local
                                        development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of
                                        problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective
                                        local vision. 3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for
                                        effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National
                                        importance. The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be
                                        comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the
                                        full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29
                                        subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. 4. A need was felt
                                        to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile,
                                        i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional
                                        mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part
                                        IX areas. Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating
                                        17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals
                                        (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ‘Whole of Government and
                                        Whole of Society Approach’ and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic
                                        approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India. 29 Subjects defined in
                                        the Eleventh Schedule Description Design a game for a Hackathon event that
                                        enhances participant engagement, fosters planning, and develops a better
                                        Panchayat/Village development The objective is to create a gamified experience
                                        that can help villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A
                                        simulated environment is needed to develop a self- sustained village development
                                        plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the village using the
                                        resources available. It is envisaged to develop ‘Farmville’ kind of a game for a
                                        village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for
                                        android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as
                                        input. Key Components to include for the game app: Budget Estimate:
                                        Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning
                                        is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the
                                        gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature
                                        planning. Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram
                                        Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage
                                        construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc. The basic steps of
                                        the Game broadly involve: - i. Select the village, where development plan is
                                        required by the villagers. ii. Based on the input received such as the village
                                        building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the
                                        existing village for which development plan is required. iii. Superimpose the
                                        SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the
                                        village. iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that
                                        a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the
                                        village, laying of drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline
                                        for all the villagers, etc. v. There is resource envelope/money available with
                                        Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work.
                                        Once the development activity as in point iv above is planned in the game, the
                                        amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats. vi.
                                        Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features. vii. Arrive at
                                        a tentative estimate for the planning being performed. viii. Ability to provide
                                        a walkthrough of the 3D platform. ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D
                                        platform. A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: - Case1:
                                        Road laying activity • The player selects the start point and endpoint with
                                        intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to
                                        validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction
                                        plan. • The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of
                                        the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game.
                                        Based on changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road,
                                        it should be regenerated. • Once the road construction is done by the player,
                                        cost of construction should be auto generated. • Ability to measure the road
                                        dimensions and road shoulders. Case 2: Streetlight • The player selects the road
                                        where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game
                                        artefacts. • The player has option to check the light illumination based on the
                                        time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to
                                        change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change – the changes to reflect on
                                        the game for best results. • Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street
                                        lighting to be generated. Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and
                                        width of each side. • The player selects the village for developmental activity.
                                        • The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected
                                        village. • The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create
                                        the dimension of the house along with roof type area. Expected Solution
                                        Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times,
                                        exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan
                                        to develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat
                                        development plan activities. • A detailed game outlining the work model. •
                                        Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface. • Documentation on
                                        implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification
                                        system into the Hackathon event. These are few of the cases described by this
                                        concept. Students should try to model maximum topics and also have a
                                        comprehensive guided documentation which leads to development of a super fine
                                        game.

                                        Background: Auminium wire rod is produced in Wire rod mills of cast house, where
                                        an aluminium cast bar of trapezoidal cross section having area 3437 sq. mm is
                                        first casted and then further rolled by 15 nos. of stand in series to gradually
                                        reduce the cross section to obtain final 9.5 mm diameter rod. Description: The
                                        casting parameters that affects the wire rod properties like UTS, Elongation and

                                        As the global shift towards renewable energy intensifies, solar trackers, which
                                        adjust solar panels to follow the sun’s path, are crucial for maximizing solar
                                        energy efficiency. Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar
                                        trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and
                                        sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by

                                        based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating
                                        an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM),
                                        designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis
                                        positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent
                                        steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost
                                        hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a
                                        prototype of this solar tracking mechanism. References: 1. Pre- Requisite:

                                        Description: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is rich in structural and
                                        textural information but lacks the intuitive appeal of color, which can provide
                                        more comprehensive insights for space borne applications. SAR image colorization
                                        using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing
                                        the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to
                                        develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced
                                        interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be
                                        designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss
                                        function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images.
                                        The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately
                                        predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more
                                        distinguishable and interpretable. Challenge: The challenges require innovative
                                        approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies
                                        to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions. Usage: The

                                        Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic
                                        investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential
                                        for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical
                                        information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively
                                        studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature.
                                        However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and
                                        reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for
                                        data recovery. Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file
                                        types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files
                                        contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and
                                        potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with
                                        their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion
                                        timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.
                                        Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like
                                        journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features
                                        enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process
                                        of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the
                                        data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the
                                        allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an
                                        opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract
                                        and analyse the deleted data. Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated
                                        with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing
                                        the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the
                                        investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a
                                        deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.
                                        Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery
                                        technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques
                                        should able to: 1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and
                                        techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data
                                        structures of XFS and Btrfs. 2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover
                                        Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp,
                                        xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar,
                                        iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc),
                                        executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1,
                                        sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.
                                        3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification,
                                        and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated
                                        with deleted files. 4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive
                                        interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports. 5.
                                        Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification
                                        mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.

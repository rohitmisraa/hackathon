                                    Description: A mobile application needs to be developed to streamline and automate the attendance tracking of its employees across multiple office locations. This application will leverage geolocation technology to record employee check-in and check-out times along with geo-location as they enter and leave the office premises. Aim of this App is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual attendance tracking errors, and provide a seamless experience for employees to manage their work-related movements. Key Requirements: 1) Geolocation-Based Check-In and Check-Out: Automatically record check-in time and geo-location when an employee enters within a 200-meter radius of his office. Record check-out time when the employee leaves the 200-meter radius. Ensure that each check-in is paired with a corresponding check-out, regardless of the frequency of entries and exits. 2) Manual Location Check-In / Check-Out for Offsite Work: Provide a manual check-in and check-out feature for employees working at locations other than his offices. Automatically suggest relevant locations based on real-time longitude and latitude data, allowing employees to confirm their check-in and check-out at these suggested locations. 3) Calculate the employees total working hours. 4) Data Accuracy and Integrity: Ensure the application maintains accurate and tamper-proof records of all check-in and check-out events. Enable real-time data synchronization and secure storage to prevent data loss and ensure reliability.

                                    Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

                                    Background: NCIIPC shares detail of cyber incidents to corresponding stakeholders in order to inform them about cyber activities related to their IT/OT infrastructure. This empowers them to take necessary actions to mitigate further risk. Description: In order to achieve objective of protecting Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIs) of the Nation, it is very vital to have real time information related to cyber threats and incidents specific to Indian Cyber space. This may enhance the Threat Assessment potential based on the incidents that have already happened or the ones that currently exists. Therefore, a framework to crawl/scrap/collect the cyber incident activities reported anywhere on the web related to Indian cyber space is required to be developed. Expected Solution: 1. Using Machine Learning, find platforms that publish or works as intermediate platform for sharing cyber incident activities related to cyber incidents. 2. Design a model framework for the cyber incidents feed generator which collects data from various forums, paste sites, social media, developer or any other platforms as identified by Machine learning model generated in accordance to point 1 above. 3. Creation of well-structured database of cyber incidents extracted by framework developed in accordance with point 2 above. 4. Generation of valuable insights from the data collected and its visual representation of cyber incidents specific to sectors, APTs and strategic issues. Note: Students are encouraged not to use paid APIs for solving the problem.

                                    Background: Efficient bus scheduling and route planning are essential for the smooth operation of public bus transport services. Currently, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) relies on manual methods for scheduling and planning, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. To improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance service reliability, DTC needs an automated software solution capable of handling both linked and unlinked duty scheduling. Additionally, the solution should facilitate route management by mapping all existing routes and highlighting overlaps with proposed new routes. This project aims to develop a comprehensive software solution to streamline bus scheduling, optimize resource utilization, and improve route planning. Detailed Description: The Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System will utilize lgorithms, data analytics, and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to automate various aspects of bus scheduling and route management. The system will potentially include (but not limited to) features such as: Linked Duty Scheduling: Assign a specific crew to a bus at the start of their duty, ensuring they remain with the bus throughout their shift. Provide tools to manage and monitor crew and bus assignments for better familiarity and accountability. Unlinked Duty Scheduling: Allow crews to hand over buses to other crew members after assigned completing their trips. Manage rest periods for crew menbers and after their reassign them to different buses rest period. Route Management: Map all existing routes and provide a visual representation of the bus network. Enable users to draw new routes and automatically highlight overlaps with existing routes. Optimize route planning to reduce congestion and improve service coverage. Expected Output: A fully functional prototype of the Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System demonstrating the above features through the integration of algorithms, data analytics, and GIS technologies. The system will offer a user-friendly interface for schedulers, planners, and managers to interact with the system, manage schedules, plan routes, and access real-time data and reports.

                                    Background: Management of solid waste has been one of the key problem in most of the cities around the world. The failure is evident from burgeoning growth of landfill site into mountain of MSW. Waste management accounts for a comparatively very high share of national GHG emissions in several countries worldwide. Emissions of methane following the disposal of waste in landfill account for a large share of GHG emissions from waste management. Description: With increasing pressure of development and urbanization, the need for efficient municipal service delivery is also growing rapidly, which the municipal bodies are very often unable to cope with. This is true in case of solid waste disposal and management as well. The main objectives of solid waste management are to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, promote recycling, and minimize the negative effects of waste on the environment and human health Expected Solution: Developing Community based solution for collection and recycling of solid waste management for developing into Net Zero waste communities. Digital solution for tracking the waste generation to waste recycling giving the effective tracking mechanism to utilities to collect, account and manage waste. Developing local solution for recycling of waste by Torrefaction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Pellets converting it into valuable product to get bioenergy Innovative solution for waste management to reduce LFG and Collecting and Treating Landfill Gas (LFG) and used as a renewable energy resource
